            <p>The series is set in the fictional town of Mystic Falls, Virginia, a town charged with supernatural history. It follows the life of Elena Gilbert (Nina Dobrev), a teenage girl who has just lost both parents in a car crash, as she falls in love with a 161-year-old vampire named Stefan Salvatore (Paul Wesley), who she thinks is just a normal human. Their relationship becomes increasingly intricate as Stefan's mysterious older brother Damon Salvatore (Ian Somerhalder) returns to Mystic Falls with a plan to bring back their past love, Katherine Pierce, who is Elena's doppelgänger. Although Damon initially holds a grudge against his brother for forcing him to become a vampire, he later reconciles with Stefan and falls in love with Elena, creating a love triangle among the three. Both brothers attempt to protect Elena as they face various villains and threats to their town, including Katherine.</p>

            <h2>Production</h2>
            <p>Initially, Kevin Williamson had little interest in developing the series, as he found the premise too similar to the Twilight novels. However, at the urging of Julie Plec, he began to read the books. He started to become intrigued by the story: "I began to realize that it was a story about a small town, about that town's underbelly and about what lurks under the surface." Williamson has stated the town's story will be the main focus of the series rather than high school.On February 6, 2009, Variety announced that The CW had green-lit the pilot for The Vampire Diaries with Williamson and Julie Plec set as the head writers and executive producers. On May 19, 2009, the series was officially ordered for the 2009–2010 season.The series was given a full 22-episode order on October 21, 2009, after strong ratings for the first half of the season. On February 16, 2010, The CW announced that it had renewed the show for a second season, which premiered on September 9, 2010. On April 26, 2011, The CW renewed the show for a third season.The third season premiered on September 15, 2011.The fourth season premiered on October 11, 2012. The CW renewed the show for a fifth season on February 11, 2013. On February 13, 2014, The CW renewed the series for a sixth season. On January 11, 2015, the CW renewed the series for a seventh season.</p>

            <h2>Not exactly</h2>
            <p>On March 11, 2016, The CW renewed the series for an eighth season, but on July 23, 2016, announced that the eighth season, consisting of 16 episodes, would be the show's last.The final season began airing on October 21, 2016, and ended March 10, 2017. President of The CW, Mark Pedowitz, said in an interview at the summer TCA's that The Vampire Diaries didn't receive an extra episode order for the second season at the request of Kevin Williamson. Kevin Williamson felt to do the best show possible; he would rather do 22 episodes. "I'd rather have a great 22 than a good 24 if Kevin couldn't do it," he explained. The writers first met for the fifth season on April 15, 2013. Filming began on July 10, 2013, and finished on April 10, 2014. On July 23, 2016, it was announced that the show would end after a 16-episode eighth season.</p>

            <h2>Critical Reception</h2>
            <p>Many TV critics felt the series improved with each episode. Sarah Hughes of The Independent says The Vampire Diaries turns into "a well-crafted, interestingly developed series", despite a poor opening episode. The New York Post also praised the portrayal of Elena, finding the character to be a strong-minded woman who did not allow her feelings for her boyfriend to control her. Karla Peterson of The San Diego Union-Tribune said that "the supernatural drama is a first-class production, featuring an insanely gorgeous cast, sharp scripts and a brooding vibe that is hard for even the most levelheaded adult to resist." Mike Hale of The New York Times gave the series an honorable mention on his list of the top TV shows of 2009. The show's second season opened to universal acclaim from professional television critics as it received a 78/100 score on Metacritic. As the series progressed and developed onto the third season, critics praised the portrayals of the main characters and the development of the female characters such as Elena Gilbert played by Nina Dobrev, Bonnie Bennett who is played by Katerina Graham, and Caroline Forbes who is played by Candice Accola. </p>

            <h2>More Critiques..</h2>
            <p>The third season finale, The Departed, opened to generally positive reviews. Diana Steenbergen of IGN praised the episode and the writers for clearing up a couple story lines and making all of them come to a head. She also praised Dobrev's performance in this episode, addressing her behavior as another reason the final revelation from Meredith was more shocking and believable. Similarly, Mandi Bierly of Entertainment Weekly review praised the writer's skills in creating the more unexpected final twist. Several reviewers also addressed the dynamic of the show may change now with the character of Elena being transitioned. Keshaunta Moton of Poptimal refers to the upcoming changes as "huge" and notes the change as something that'll affect her relationship with other characters.

            <p>Vampirism in TVD serves as a metaphor for puberty, sexuality, and adolescence. The show depicts teenagers becoming vampires, which can be seen as mimicking sexual maturity or exploring one’s sexuality. Characters’ need to regulate their vampirism over time recalls the process of coping with sexual desire, discrimination/ ostracization, or heightened emotions. The series shows vampires as more sympathetic than monstrous and offers many examples of vampires being good people as they minimize the harm that comes with their bloodlust and use their supernatural powers to protect their loved ones. By presenting vampirism as neither good nor bad and simply as a part of oneself that must be managed, much like any other personality trait, the series argues that suppression is not a healthy or reliable way to deal with the things that vampirism is allegorizing: sexuality and the challenges and changes of adolescence.</p>

            <h2>Vampirism as Puberty</h2>
            <p>While the characters in TVD discover their own relationship with sexuality, they also engage in the social and familial challenges associated with adolescence and grapple internally with the extent to which they should suppress or hide their true identities, as either vampires or as sexually active adults. The “transition” from human to vampire mirrors the process of puberty. There are several steps in becoming a vampire: a human must consume vampire blood, then die, then wake up and drink human blood. Elena “transitions” and becomes a vampire in an episode appropriately titled “Growing Pains.” While transitioning, one’s senses and emotions become stronger and more volatile, much like a human teenager’s emotions become more volatile due to high hormone levels during puberty. In the real world, teenagers “experience wider and quicker mood swings” than adults (Larson), and these mood swings are dramatized by vampires losing control of their desire for blood. “My emotions are all over the place... everything’s heightened,” Elena explains . She explains how she “can’t stop feeling this grief” and has intercourse with Stefan in the woods. When a vampire’s hunger becomes more intense, they experience more mood swings.</p>

            <h2>Vampirism and....</h2>
            <aside >
                <h3>Vampirism and Gender</h3>
                <p>Female self-control is more prevalent in TVD than male self-control, and male indulgence is more prevalent than female indulgence. When Caroline is unwillingly turned into a vampire by one of the villains in the show, Stefan and Damon fear how she is going to cope because of her teenage dramatics and insecurities. “Caroline, of all people, will not make it as a vampire,” Damon explains to Elena . However, as the series progresses, Caroline becomes one of the most well- adjusted vampires of all. Stefan describes her in season six as “neat, organized Caroline, staying within lines, good at control” . She exclusively drinks hospital blood bags and kills only a few people by mistake, compared to the hundreds killed by Stefan and Damon, the ultra-masculine vampires in the show. When Stefan and Damon expected Caroline to struggle with her newfound vampirism because of the self-control it would require of her, they mirror male concern over female promiscuity. </p>

            <section>
                <h3>Teen-Parent Relationships</h3>
                <p>Storylines in TVD also include conflicts between parents and children about magic and vampires. Vampirism is presented as something that parents just do not understand and something that their children are open to and may even know well. These conflicts can be understood as metaphorizing the challenges of watching one’s child go through puberty and become an adult themselves. Most parental figures in TVD are either absent or harmful. Bridgeman writes that the characters’ “fathers tend to be domineering and violent... [and] mothers tend to be absent, selfish or ineffective” (Bridgeman), resulting in many of the characters being underdeveloped emotionally or having unresolved trauma from their childhood. Elena, for example, is an orphan. Bridgeman writes that Elena’s story is “one of alienation in the wake of grief, well-trod thematic ground for Gothic and adolescent literature.” She further observes that Elena’s depression after the death of her parents isolates her from her former, happy self. </p>

            <section>
                <h3>Vampirism in Literature</h3>
                <p>The vampire was made famous by Bram Stoker’s Dracula (1897), but that novel was not the first documented instance of the vampire genre. Goethe’s Die Braut von Korinth (1797) and Polidori’s The Vampyre, A Tale (1819) are generally considered to be the origins of vampire literature, inspired by centuries-old folklore (Carlson 26). Over time, writers and artists of all sorts have been fascinated with and have continued to create narratives about vampires. Since the emergence of the first vampire works in the nineteenth century, there has been a “sexual element in the relationship between the literary vampire and his victim” (Carlson 30). This element has evolved over time from a damsel-in- distress trope of an innocent young woman bitten by a much older, stronger vampire to a variety of sexually charged circumstances (Carlson 30). In TVD and other contemporary vampire media like Twilight (2008 film) and Buffy the Vampire Slayer (1997-2003), vampire sexuality is a more explicit and important part of the narrative.</p>
